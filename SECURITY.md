# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to provide security updates for:

- The latest stable release (the most recent tagged version in this repository)
- The primary development branch (for example, `main` or `master`)

Older releases may continue to function but are not routinely tested or patched
for security issues. If you rely on an older version, you are strongly
encouraged to upgrade to the latest stable release before reporting
vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this project, please
report it using one of the following options:

- Use the GitHub “Report a vulnerability” / Security Advisories workflow for
  this repository, if available.
- If that is not available, contact the maintainers using the contact
  information provided in the repository’s README or project homepage.

Please **do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. We will
review your report, respond as soon as reasonably possible, and coordinate a
fix and disclosure timeline with you if the issue is confirmed.
